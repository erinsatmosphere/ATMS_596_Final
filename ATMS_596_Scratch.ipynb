    "# ENSO Diversity and Tropical Cyclone Activity in the Eastern and Central Pacific (1979–2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "### INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates how **ENSO diversity**, specifically Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño, Central Pacific (CP) El Niño, Neutral ENSO, and La Niña events—modulates tropical cyclone (TC) activity in the Eastern Pacific (ENP) and Central Pacific (CNP) basins during the satellite era (1979–2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "ENSO influences tropical cyclones through changes in:\n",
    "- Sea-surface temperature patterns\n",
    "- Vertical wind shear\n",
    "- Moisture distribution\n",
    "- Atmospheric circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Different ENSO “flavors” affect the Pacific differently. EP El Niño warms the eastern equatorial Pacific, while CP (Modoki-type) El Niño warms the central Pacific, leading to distinct atmospheric teleconnections.\n",
    "Understanding these differences allows us to answer:\n",
    "- \"Do EP and CP El Niño events influence TC intensity differently?\"\n",
    "- \"Do storms form in different locations depending on ENSO type?\"\n",
    "- \"Are certain ENSO flavors associated with more extreme seasons?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Study Region**\n",
    "- **Eastern Pacific (ENP):** 0–40°N, 220–260°E\n",
    "- **Central Pacific (CNP):** 0–40°N, 180–220°E\n",
    "- **Tropical Pacific ENSO Regions:** Niño1+2 (EP signal), Niño4 (CP signal) using ERSSTv5 SST anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "These regions reflect established definitions used by NOAA, CPC, and peer-reviewed ENSO research\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Datasets Used**\n",
    "- **NOAA ERSSTv5** – Monthly global SSTs (for ENSO indices & composites)\n",
    "- **NOAA IBTrACS v04r00** – Best‑track tropical cyclone positions, winds, and metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are publicly available, long-term, and widely used in operational / research climate studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Core Analyses Performed**\n",
    "1. **ENSO Index Construction** – Niño1+2 and Niño4 JJASO mean anomalies & ENSO-type classification\n",
    "2. **TC Activity Metrics** – ACE (sum of v²), MaxWind, and storm translation speeds\n",
    "3. **Statistical Testing** -\n",
    "  - Distribution comparisons (descriptives)\n",
    "  - Bootstrap confidence intervals\n",
    "  - Welch t-tests (EP vs CP)\n",
    " - OLS regression (ACE ~ ENSO type)\n",
    " - Extreme-year frequencies (top 10%)\n",
    "4. **Spatial Diagnostics** -\n",
    " - Genesis locations\n",
    " - 2D KDE-style genesis density maps\n",
    " - SST anomaly composites (EP, CP, La Niña)\n",
    "5. **Basin-Separated Analysis** – ENP vs CNP examined independently\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Why These Analyses?**\n",
    "These methods target physical and statistical questions central to ENSO–TC research:\n",
    "- \"Does EP/CP El Niño alter where storms form? their intensities? their translation speeds?\"\n",
    "- \"Do SST composites confirm proper ENSO-type classification?\"\n",
    "- \"Are observed differences statistically meaningful or within natural variability?\"\n",
    "- \"Does the ENP respond differently to ENSO than the CNP?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these analyses create a **complete, reproducible, and physically grounded assessment** of how ENSO diversity influences Pacific cyclone activity.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### DATA DOWNLOADS & SETUP\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Datasets Used\n",
    "1. NOAA ERSSTv5 (Sea Surface Temperature)\n",
    "    - Monthly global SSTs\n",
    "    - 2°×2° resolution\n",
    "    - Ideal for basin-scale ENSO diagnostics\n",
    "    - Anomalies computed relative to 1981–2010 (WMO climatology period)\n",
    "    - Citation: Huang et al. (2017). Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature, Version 5 (ERSSTv5): Upgrades, Validations, and Intercomparisons. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0836.1\n",
    "2. NOAA IBTrACS v04r00 (Tropical Cyclone Best Tracks)\n",
    "    - Global best-track record, harmonized across agencies\n",
    "    - Includes TC locations, intensities, times, and metadata\n",
    "    - Suitable for intensity metrics like ACE and MaxWind\n",
    "    - Citation: Knapp et al. (2010). The International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS). DOI: https://doi.org/10.1175/2009BAMS2755.1\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Study the ENP and CNP?\n",
    "The Eastern and Central Pacific basins are highly sensitive to ENSO variability:\n",
    "- ENP storms tend to intensify more during EP El Niño, when warming shifts eastward and shear weakens.\n",
    "- CNP storms are more active during CP El Niño, as convection shifts westward.\n",
    "- La Niña tends to suppress activity in both basins due to cooler SSTs and stronger shear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining precise study boxes allows us to compare basin-separated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Use the 1979–2023 Study Period?\n",
    "Selecting an appropriate analysis window is critical in TC–ENSO research because both the observational record and the observing systems have changed significantly over time. The years 1979–2023 represent the most physically and statistically consistent period for studying ENSO–TC interactions in the Pacific.\n",
    "1. Start Year = 1979 (Beginning of the Satellite Era)\n",
    "    - 1979 marks the onset of continuous global geostationary satellite coverage, including: GOES, GMS, Meteosat, and polar-orbiting NOAA platforms\n",
    "    - allows reliable detection of remote Pacific storms for the first time\n",
    "    - prior to ~1978, Eastern and especially Central Pacific storms were under-detected, poorly sampled, and had less reliable intensity estimates. This introduces strong inhomogeneities in storm counts, track detection, maximum sustained wind, and duration / track completeness\n",
    "2. End Year = 2023 (Last Fully Available Year)\n",
    "    - ERSSTv5 and IBTrACS both report complete, stable datasets through 2023 in reproducible form.\n",
    "3. ENSO Classification Benefits from Full JJASO Records\n",
    "    - ENSO indices require multi-month averages. Using 1979–2023 ensures full JJASO seasons for every year, consistent 30-yr climatology (1981–2010) inside the analysis window, and proper ENSO flavor classification (EP vs CP) based on mature seasonal SST patterns\n",
    "4. Ensures ACE and MaxWind Are Comparable Across Decades\n",
    "    - ACE and MaxWind depend on 6-hourly wind estimates, storm lifetime tracking, and ability to detect storms far from land\n",
    "5. Matches Standard Practice in ENSO Research\n",
    "    - Many ENSO and TC studies use similar windows: Boucharel et al. (2016), Patricola et al. (2018), and Song et al. (2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ENSO EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Compute Niño1+2 and Niño4 Indices?\n",
    "ENSO is not a single phenomenon; it is expressed in multiple spatial patterns:\n",
    "- Niño1+2 (EP El Niño): eastern Pacific warming\n",
    "- Niño4 (CP El Niño): central Pacific warming\n",
    "- By computing JJASO-mean Niño1+2 and Niño4 indices, we can classify ENSO years:\n",
    "    - EP El Niño: Niño1+2 ≥ +0.5°C and > Niño4\n",
    "    - CP El Niño: Niño4 ≥ +0.5°C and > Niño1+2\n",
    "    - La Niña: either index ≤ –0.5°C\n",
    "    - Neutral: neither threshold reached\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How ENSO Indices Are Computed in This Study\n",
    "This study constructs ENSO indices directly from ERSSTv5 monthly sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies. These indices are used to classify years into Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño, Central Pacific (CP) El Niño, La Niña, and Neutral categories. The method follows standard practices used by NOAA and the ENSO-diversity research community.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SST Anomalies Relative to a 1981–2010 Climatology\n",
    "\n",
    "    ENSO indices are computed from SST anomalies, The 1981–2010 period is used because it is the World Meteorological Organization’s standard 30-year base period; it aligns with the modern satellite era, improving spatial and temporal consistency; it removes the annual SST cycle and long-term warming trends, isolating interannual variability associated with ENSO; and it matches the baseline used in ENSO literature, ensuring comparability across studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Defining Niño Regions Used to Capture ENSO Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "    Two regions are used to represent the spatial structure of ENSO: Niño 1+2 (Eastern Pacific signal) 10°S–0°, 90–80°W (270–280°E in 0–360° coordinates), and Niño 4 (Central Pacific/Modoki signal) 5°S–5°N, 160°E–150°W (160–210°E). Niño 1+2 captures canonical eastern Pacific warming, while Niño 4 captures central Pacific warming typical of Modoki or CP El Niño events. These definitions are consistent with NOAA CPC, Kug et al. (2009), Kim et al. (2011), and Capotondi et al. (2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cosine-Latitude Weighting for Area-Weighted Regional Means\n",
    "\n",
    "    Grid cells represent different surface areas depending on latitude. To compute true area-averaged SSTs, each grid point is weighted which ensures accurate regional averages and avoids overweighting high-latitude grid cells. This is the same weighting used in NOAA’s operational ENSO indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Seasonal Averaging Over JJASO\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each year, Niño1+2 and Niño4 anomalies are averaged over June–October (JJASO) - JJASO is chosen because it corresponds to the active ENP/CNP hurricane season.\n",
    "    ENSO’s atmospheric teleconnections during these months strongly influence tropical cyclone activity and using the same season for both the ENSO index and the TC metrics ensures consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ENSO-Type Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "    Years are categorized into ENSO types using seasonal Niño1+2 and Niño4 anomalies:\n",
    "- EP El Niño:\n",
    "    - Niño1+2 ≥ +0.5°C\n",
    "\n",
    "        AND\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Niño1+2 > Niño4\n",
    "- CP El Niño:\n",
    "    - Niño4 ≥ +0.5°C\n",
    "        \n",
    "        AND\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Niño4 > Niño1+2\n",
    "- La Niña:\n",
    "    - Either index ≤ −0.5°C\n",
    "- Neutral:\n",
    "    - Neither threshold reached\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach captures spatial ENSO diversity and is widely used in ENSO-TC impact studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Scientific Rationale for This Approach\n",
    "Computing ENSO indices in this way allows us to accurately capture the spatial structure of ENSO events, separate EP and CP El Niño events based on their physical characteristics rather than relying on a single index, aligns ENSO metrics with the seasonal cycle of tropical cyclone activity, and ensures reproducibility through transparent and standard data processing steps. These ENSO indices underpin all subsequent analyses in the project, including TC intensity metrics, spatial diagnostics, statistical comparisons, and composites.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Compute ENSO indexes and classify events\n",
    "\n",
    "### ENSO INDEX VISUALIZATION AND EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What We Expect to See in ENSO EDA:\n",
    "The ENSO exploratory analysis reveals:\n",
    "- Interannual variability and shifts between EP/CP patterns\n",
    "- Major ENSO events (1982–83, 1997–98, 2015–16)\n",
    "- Relative dominance of EP vs CP warming\n",
    "- Multi-decadal variability (possible regime shifts)\n",
    "- This helps validate that ENSO classification agrees with physical SST patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overall Interpretation and Significance across ENSO Index and EDA Section:\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all diagnostic plots, there is a consistent literature-backed story:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ENSO diversity shown in this dataset: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - EP events are strong, rare, and extreme\n",
    "    - CP events are frequent, moderate, and becoming more common\n",
    "    - these differences can map onto TC behavior differences\n",
    "\n",
    "- ENSO index derivation is scientifically valid\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the Niño1+2 vs Niño4 phase space reproduces the known EP/CP separation found in published ENSO climatologies\n",
    "\n",
    "- decadal changes indicate a shift toward CP-like warming\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This matches multiple peer-reviewed findings that the structure of ENSO has changed since the 1990s\n",
    "\n",
    "- ENSO type frequencies align with known climate variability patterns - this supports the TC–ENSO hypotheses:\n",
    "    - EP: stronger ENP storms (higher ACE/MaxWind)\n",
    "    - CP: westward-shifted genesis and weaker ENP effect\n",
    "    - La Niña: suppression of TC activity\n",
    "\n",
    "- these diagnostics justify the methodology used in this study\n",
    "\n",
    "    - mapping ENSO types is not arbitrary — it’s grounded in observed data, physically meaningful SST structures, peer-reviewed ENSO diversity research, and has clear implications for TC energetics\n",
    "\n",
    "### PLOT STUDY AREA\n",
    "\n",
    "### TC EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Assign Basins by Genesis?\n",
    "Tropical cyclone operational basins depend on where storms form, not where they travel. Assigning basin as the location of first fix ensures ENP storms that cross into the CNP remain ENP-origin storms, Central Pacific-origin storms are not lumped into ENP statistics, and seasonal ACE and intensity metrics remain consistent with NOAA's definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Classify each storm by basin\n",
